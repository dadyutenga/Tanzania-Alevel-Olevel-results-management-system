# Class Management System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Complete class management system with Classes, Sections, and Class-Section Allocations.

## Structure

### Models Used
- `ClassModel` - Manages classes (Form 1, Form 2, etc.)
- `SectionModel` - Manages sections (A, B, C, etc.)
- `ClassSectionModel` - Manages class-section allocations (Form 1-A, Form 2-B, etc.)

### Controller
**ClassManagementController** - Single controller handling all operations:
- Classes CRUD
- Sections CRUD
- Allocations CRUD

### Views (All in app/Views/class/)
1. **index.php** - List all classes
2. **manage.php** - Create/Edit class form
3. **sections_index.php** - List all sections
4. **sections_manage.php** - Create/Edit section form
5. **allocations_index.php** - List all class-section allocations
6. **allocations_manage.php** - Create/Edit allocation form (with dropdowns)

### Class-Section Allocations
- Link classes with sections (e.g., Form 1 + Section A)

## Technical Implementation

### Delete Operations
- All delete operations use POST method
- Immediate response with `->send()` and `exit`
- No debug toolbar interference

- JSON response format

### Form Submissions
- Normal POST submissions (no AJAX for forms)
- Flash messages for success/error feedback
- Validation with error display
- Old input preservation on errors

### AJAX Endpoints
- getClasses, getSections, getAllocations
- JSON responses with status and data
- Error handling with try-catch
- Excluded from debug toolbar

### UI/UX
- Consistent green theme (#4AE54A)
- Responsive design
- SweetAlert2 for confirmations
- Loading states
- Status badges (Active/Inactive)
- Mobile-friendly sidebar toggle

## Database Tables
- `classes` - Stores class information
- `sections` - Stores section information
- `class_sections` - Junction table for class-section relationships
