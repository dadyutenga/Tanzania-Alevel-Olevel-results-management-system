## Technical Details

### Models Used
1. **StudentModel** - Students table
2. **StudentSessionModel** - Student-class-section-session mapping
3. **ClassModel** - Classes data
4. **SectionModel** - Sections data
5. **SessionModel** - Academic sessions
6. **SettingsModel** - School settings (for default session)

### Database Tables

#### students
- id (UUID, PK)
- firstname (varchar 100)
- middlename (varchar 100)
- lastname (varchar 100)
- image (varchar 255, can be empty)
- dob (date)
- gender (enum: male/female/other)
- guardian_phone (varchar 15)
- is_active (enum: yes/no)
- created_by (UUID)
- updated_by (UUID)
- school_id (UUID)
- created_at (datetime)
- updated_at (datetime)

#### student_session
- id (UUID, PK)
- session_id (UUID, FK → sessions.id)
- student_id (UUID, FK → students.id)
- class_id (UUID, FK → classes.id)
- section_id (UUID, FK → sections.id)
- is_active (enum: yes/no)
- created_at (datetime)
- updated_at (datetime)
- created_by (UUID)
- updated_by (UUID)
- school_id (UUID)

### Session Auto-Loading
The system automatically loads the current session from the settings table:
1. Get user_uuid from session
2. Query SettingsModel::getSchoolByUserId($userId)
3. Extract school_year from settings
4. Find corresponding session record
5. Pre-select in dropdowns

### Validation Rules

#### Single Student
- firstname: required, min 2 chars, max 100 chars
- middlename: optional, max 100 chars
- lastname: required, min 2 chars, max 100 chars
- dob: required, valid date
- gender: required, in_list[male,female,other]
- guardian_phone: required, min 10 chars, max 15 chars
- class_id: required
- section_id: required
- session_id: required
- is_active: optional, in_list[yes,no], default 'yes'

#### Bulk Registration
- class_id: required (once for all students)
- section_id: required (once for all students)
- session_id: required (once for all students)
- students array: required, must have at least one student
- Each student: same validation as single student

### Transaction Handling
**Single Student:**
1. Insert into students table
2. Get student_id
3. Insert into student_session table
4. If step 3 fails, rollback step 1

**Bulk Registration:**
1. Loop through students array
2. For each student:
   - Insert into students table
   - Insert into student_session table
   - Track success/error count
3. Return summary with counts and error details

### Performance
- **List View:** Uses JOIN query to fetch all data in one call
- **Delete:** Immediate response pattern (setContentType → setBody → send → exit)
- **Bulk Insert:** Transaction-safe batch processing
- **Search:** Client-side filtering for instant results

## UI/UX

### Design
- Green theme (#4AE54A) for primary actions
- Purple gradient background
- White content cards with shadows
- Responsive sidebar with mobile toggle
- SweetAlert2 for confirmations

### Icons (Font Awesome)

- fa-plus-circle: Add student
- fa-users-cog: Bulk register
- fa-edit: Edit button

- fa-save: Save button
